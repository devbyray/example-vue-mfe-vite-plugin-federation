**GitHub Copilot Instructions**

> A guide to help us get the best out of GitHub Copilot across our projects.


## ðŸ§± Project Overview

This repository is an example project demonstrating how to build a module-federated micro-frontend architecture using Vue 3 and Vite within a monorepo managed by PNPM. It showcases independent micro-frontend apps, file-based routing, and code sharing via Module Federation, providing a scalable and maintainable foundation for modern web applications.

**Tech stack:** Vue.js 3 (frontend), Vite (build tool), Module Federation (via OriginJS vite-plugin-federation), PNPM (monorepo management), Vitest (testing), CSS modules.
